Context: Continued from “RSOC API – Reset & Clean Stage.1”. Cloud Shell + GitHub repo afs-rsoc-api-v2.

What happened:

Pulled latest (git pull) → repo up to date.

Ran ./scripts/quickstart.sh → GCP project set; IAM policies on secrets updated (RSOC_API_TOKEN_STG, DATABASE_URL_STG); Cloud Run deploy OK; new Revision created successfully.

Current state:

Cloud Run service healthy; secrets wired; DB reachable via DATABASE_URL_STG.

Reset/Clean flow works end-to-end.

Decisions / Notes:

Keep quickstart.sh as the single-entry deploy routine.

Proceed to M2 validation + hardening.

Next actions:

Smoke & health checks (HTTP + DB) and store outputs in /artifacts/.

Begin M2 API hardening scaffold: auth, rate limits, validation, idempotency, traceId.
